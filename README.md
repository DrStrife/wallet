Wisp
====

Wisp is a proof-of-stake network under development. This is the official source code repository.

This code is not yet ready for production use, but a testnet will be announced soon for public testing before the Wisp blockchain forks from the Spectrecoin blockchain at a date to be announced.

If you are a user and want to download a stable wallet, please use the Spectrecoin wallet (https://github.com/spectrecoin/spectre) until the first stable Wisp wallet has been released.
